# 🚢 Survival Prediction on Titanic Dataset

## 📌 Overview
This project explores the Titanic dataset to analyze passenger survival patterns.  
It includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Feature Engineering**, and **Machine Learning models** to predict survival.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset comes from the classic [Titanic Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).  
It contains passenger information such as age, gender, ticket class, family size, and more.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🚀 Project Goals
- Perform data cleaning and EDA  
- Engineer meaningful features (e.g., Family Size, Title, Deck)  
- Train ML models to predict survival  
- Compare model performances
